Tasks:

Allow comments in source file.

Need sub commands: prep, web and print.  Prep copies the image file and writes the HTML,
CSS and SVG files.  Web just refreshes the SVG, and includes dots for the points.
Print creates a scaled image for the cutter.  Maybe add logic to web includes items
that aren't in the cutter version, such as points.

Need to specify background image.  App will copy this to output directory with a generic
name that the HTML references.  App will also read the dimensions of this file and use
them for the SVG.

Specify stroke color.

Need to put dimensions of image in CSS and HTML files as well as SVG file.  It might
be easiest to run sed in an external process.  Correction: use Substitute in strings
package.

A list of points, with ID's.  This allows a given point to be used in more than one place,
and be easily changed.

A list of objects.  Objects can contain curves and/or poly-lines.  App will find the
bounding rectangle of each object, and use the center of that rectangle as center of
the object.  This center is used for translation/rotation/flipping.

The output.  A list of objects, with a possible translation/rotation/flipping for each.
Perhaps scaling for each.



Done:

Use cli package.

Output directory can be specified via flag on the command line, or environment
variable.
