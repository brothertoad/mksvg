Tasks:

Need sub commands: prep, web and print.  Prep copies the image file and writes the HTML,
CSS and SVG files.  Web just refreshes the SVG, and includes dots for the points.
Print creates a scaled image for the cutter.  Maybe add logic to web includes items
that aren't in the cutter version, such as points.

Need to specify background image.  App will copy this to output directory with a generic
name that the HTML references.  App will also read the dimensions of this file and use
them for the SVG.

Need to put dimensions of image in CSS and HTML files as well as SVG file.  It might
be easiest to run sed in an external process.  Correction: use Substitute in strings
package.
